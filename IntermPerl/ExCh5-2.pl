# Modify the code from this chapter so that each source machineâ€™s
# portion of the output shows the total bytes from that machine. List
# the source machines in order from most to least data transferred.
# Within each group, list the destination machines in order from most
# to least data transferred to that target from the source machine:

#    professor.hut => gilligan.hut: 1845
#    professor.hut => maryann.hut: 90
#
# The result should be that the machine that sent the most data will be
# the first source machine in the list, and the first destination
# should be the machine to which it sent the most data.
